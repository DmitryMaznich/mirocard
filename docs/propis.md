# Прописи (propis) topic

Handwriting-practice topic. Fully independent from `letter_writing` ("Написание
букв") — no shared code or data with it, by explicit design decision. Don't touch
`letter_writing` while working on this.

## Status

- **Mode 1 "Учим буквы" (practice) — shipped, live on `main`.** Portrait-locked,
  fullscreen: custom on-screen keyboard (not the system keyboard) at the bottom,
  a large looping handwriting-animation card in the middle.
- **Mode 2 (PDF export for print) — not started.** `PropisShowView.jsx` (see below)
  is a dormant starting point for it, not wired to any active mode.

## File map

- `src/topics/renderers/propis/`
  - `propisRuling.js` — single source of truth for the ruling geometry (row zones,
    baseline position, letter scale factor). Read this first before changing
    anything visual; both views import from it.
  - `LoopingLetterCell.jsx` — renders one letter/element, animated, looping
    forever until unmounted. Shared by both views.
  - `PropisPracticeView.jsx` — the **active** mode ("Учим буквы").
  - `PropisShowView.jsx` — **dormant**, not routed to by any mode in
    `tools/propis/topic.json`. Full-page multi-row layout, kept as the starting
    point for the PDF-export mode.
  - `index.jsx` — routes `task.type` to the right view.
  - `engine.js` — `generateTasks(mode, cards)`; trivial, just passes filtered
    cards through as `items`.
  - `propis.css` — paper/ink colors are intentionally NOT tied to any theme
    toggle (this app has no dark mode anyway, but even so: paper is always
    light/white, never reversible).
- `tools/propis/topic.json` — source manifest (meta/modes/cards). Edit this,
  then rebuild the zip (see below) and bump `public/decks/catalog.json`'s
  `propis` entry (`version` + `url`) to match.
- `public/decks/propis_vX.Y.Z.zip` — just `topic.json` zipped alone, no media
  folder. This topic's renderer is code-owned (compiled into the app itself,
  registered in `src/topics/registry.js` / `engineRegistry.js`), not a dynamic
  plugin, so the deck doesn't need to ship renderer code the way e.g.
  `tools/comparison`/`tools/symmetry_draw` do.
- `tools/letter_capture/handwriting_capture.html` — standalone, offline tool for
  capturing new letters/elements by hand (phone or desktop). Exports a JSON
  array (`type/label/viewBox/strokes`) that gets merged into `topic.json`'s
  `cards`. Has its own fullscreen forced-landscape drawing mode.
- 8 letters captured so far: Б, б, В, в, А, а, Г, г.

## Key design decisions (why, not just what)

- **Row ruling**: one row = 4 lines / 3 gaps, top to bottom: line, 10mm, line,
  5mm ("узкая строка"), line **(= baseline, bold)**, 10mm, line. Total 25mm, no
  margin before the first line or after the last.
- **Letter scale**: letters are scaled so their own x-height body (units 62–88,
  i.e. 26 units, in the original font-formation "2:1:2" system every captured
  letter's path data was extracted against) matches the ruling's узкая строка
  (5mm) exactly — not the letter's whole 150-unit box against the whole row,
  which would underscale the body (ascenders/descenders eat into that 150
  units too).
- **Baseline anchor**: letters are re-*positioned* (never re-drawn/re-scaled
  per-glyph) so their baked-in baseline (unit 88) lands exactly on the
  ruling's bold baseline line. Pure translate, letter geometry itself is
  never touched.
- **Diagonal slant**: 65°-from-horizontal, matches
  `make_lined_paper_landscape_standard.py`. Must lean "/" (bottom-left to
  top-right — right-leaning cursive). That PDF script computes it in
  bottom-up PDF coordinates; SVG is top-down, so reusing its `(x, x+dx)` pair
  unmodified mirrors the slant. See the swap in `buildDiagonalLines`.
- **Ruling line thickness on the practice card**: the card is a stylised
  zoomed-in crop (`CARD_W_MM`), not real page scale — its stroke-widths are
  computed proportionally to its own `CARD_W_MM` (`STROKE_SCALE` in
  `PropisPracticeView.jsx`), not hardcoded absolute mm. If `LINE_MM` changes
  again, this auto-adjusts. Don't hand-tune stroke-width numbers directly —
  changing crop width silently doubles/halves on-screen thickness even when
  the mm value in the CSS doesn't change (this caused several rounds of "still
  too thick" bugs — see git history on `propisRuling.js`/`propis.css` for the
  full story if you need the reasoning).
- **Capture tool export quirk**: a letter exported from
  `handwriting_capture.html` is not guaranteed to start at x=0 in its 3-slot
  canvas (`viewBox="0 0 300 150"`) — "а" was found at x≈197–220 (slot 2/3),
  not slot 1. Always check/normalize each new letter's stroke bounding box
  (shift so it starts at x=0) before adding it as a card — see the git commit
  "Add captured letters А, а, Г, г" for the normalization approach. Root cause
  in the capture tool itself not yet found.

## Verifying visual changes locally (no full app flow needed)

Installing the deck through the app's catalog + picking cards + starting a
session is slow for iterating on visuals. Faster loop:

1. Create a throwaway `dev-propis.html` (bare HTML, `<div id="root">` +
   `<script type="module" src="/src/dev-propis-preview.jsx">`).
2. Create a throwaway `src/dev-propis-preview.jsx` that `createRoot`s
   `<PropisRenderer task={{ type: "practice", items: [...] }} onAdvance={...}
   onClose={...} />` directly, with `items` hardcoded from
   `tools/propis/topic.json`'s cards.
3. `npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`, open `/dev-propis.html`, screenshot
   (Playwright works headless for this).
4. **Delete both throwaway files before committing** — never commit them.
